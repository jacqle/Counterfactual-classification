# Detecting counterfactual statements
A classification system for SemEval-2020 Task 5: Detecting Counterfactuals. 

## Task Description
To model counterfactual semantics and reasoning in natural language, our shared task aims to provide a benchmark for two basic problems.

Subtask1: Detecting counterfactual statements
In this task, participants were asked to determine whether a given statement is counterfactual or not. Counterfactual statements describe events that did not actually happen or cannot happen, as well as the possible consequence if the events have had happened. More specifically, counterfactuals describe events counter to facts and hence naturally involve common sense, knowledge, and reasoning. Tackling this problem is the basis for all down-stream counterfactual related causal inference analysis in natural language. For example, the following statements are counterfactuals that need to be detected: one from healthcare and one from the finance domain:

* Her post-traumatic stress could have been avoided if a combination of paroxetine and exposure therapy had been prescribed two months earlier.
* Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade noted that if a jump in tomato prices had been factored out, inflation would have begun to drop.
While the above examples are chosen for clarity for demonstration, real statements are harder for computers to judge.
